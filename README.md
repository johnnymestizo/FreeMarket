FreeMarket
==========

FreeMarket is a Wordpress theme tailored for [MarketPress](http://premium.wpmudev.org/project/e-commerce/) stores.
Its goal is to be a visually minimalistic theme, focused on usability. No complex configurations, just enable and you're good to go.
There are no administration pages added. Instead any available theme options are visible on WordPress's theme customizer.

This theme relies on the theme customizer which was introduced on WordPress 3.4 so do not attempt to install on older versions.
